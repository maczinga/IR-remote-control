IR-remote-control
=================

This a repository for IR remote controls key-codes that I could come across. I will post a header file per remote control.
Each header contains a series of tables, one per key. To each key I tried to give a visual name in order to easyly 
recognise it on the remote control keypad.
Tables are sequence of pairs : frenquence and duration.

In the near future I will try to upload also images of the controls. Images will have the same filename of the
header.

Stay tuned. Collaboration is welcome.
